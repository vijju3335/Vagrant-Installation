## Vagrant-Installation
vagrant-installation on WINDOWS

## Project Overview
  Vagrant provides easy to configure, reproducible, and portable work environments built on top of industry-standard technology and controlled by a single consistent workflow to help maximize the productivity and flexibility of you and your team.Once you or someone else creates a single Vagrantfile, you just need to vagrant up and everything is installed and configured for you to work. Other members of your team create their development environments from the same configuration, so whether you are working on Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows, all your team members are running code in the same environment, against the same dependencies, all configured the same way. Say goodbye to "works on my machine" bugs.

- TO start vagrant,
```D:\VM_14.0.4>vagrant up```  [live demo](https://github.com/vijju3335/LogsAnalysis/blob/master/images/v2.JPG)
- To control **Virtual Machine** from Host Sytem
```\VM_14.04>vagrant ssh```  [live demo](https://github.com/vijju3335/LogsAnalysis/blob/master/images/v3.JPG)
- To Access shared Directory Folders,

```
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:/vagrant$ ls -a
.  ..  .vagrant  Vagrantfile
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:/vagrant$ 
```
- To stop vagrant virtual box , 
```
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:/vagrant$
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:/vagrant$ exit
logout
Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed.

D:\VM_14.0.4>vagrant halt
==> default: Attempting graceful shutdown of VM...

D:\VM_14.0.4>
```
